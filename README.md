A simple and beginner-friendly crypto trading bot built with Python. This project connects to the Binance **Futures Testnet** and allows you to place basic orders like **Market** and **Limit** for Buy or Sell sides.

The bot supports both **command-line interface (CLI)** and a clean **graphical interface (GUI)** built using Tkinter.

## üìå What This Project Does

This bot lets users:

- Place Market or Limit orders on Binance Testnet (USDT-M Futures)
- Choose Buy or Sell side manually
- Run from terminal or use a simple desktop-style app (GUI)
- Log all order activity and errors for debugging
- Learn how real crypto exchange bots interact with APIs

## üõ† How to Use This Project

### 1. Clone this Repo

Clone or download the folder to your local system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trading-bot.git
cd trading-bot
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist, simply run:

```bash
pip install python-binance
```

### 4. Add API Keys

Go to `config.py` and paste your Binance Testnet API credentials:

```python
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
API_SECRET = "your_api_secret_here"
```

> If you couldn‚Äôt get keys from Binance Testnet, you can still test the GUI with mock values.

## üß† Why I Built This

This project was built as part of a hiring challenge for a Junior Python Developer role in the crypto trading space. I wanted to:

- Learn how APIs work with Binance
- Practice safe and modular coding in Python
- Build both a CLI and GUI interface from scratch
- Show real-world application of Python in Web3 trading
